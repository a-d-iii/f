# Faculty Ranker Front-end

This is a static site built with Astro 4, Tailwind CSS and Motion One. It lists sample faculty profiles with placeholder ratings. Images use remote placeholders from placehold.co.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # start local dev server
npm run build # build to ./dist
```

Open `http://localhost:4321` while running `npm run dev`.

## Installing new dependencies

This project now relies on the Supabase JavaScript client. After pulling the
latest changes, make sure to reinstall dependencies so that `@supabase/supabase-js`
is available:

```bash
npm install
```
